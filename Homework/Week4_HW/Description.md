# Desicription
The name of this work is "You."

There are a lot of roses which have all different colors. Their shapes are all the same, but they have their own colors and positions.

It can be the same as humans. We are all different from each other, and each of us is special by the way we are.

I wanted to express that there are various people in the world, and we should respect others as they are.
